# Electricity-Production-Forecasting

### Introduction

The dataset under analysis pertains to the industrial production of electric and gas utilities in the United States, spanning the years 1985 to 2018. This monthly production output data provides a comprehensive overview of the energy sector's performance over more than three decades. By examining this dataset, we aim to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and other significant characteristics that can inform energy policy, operational planning, and future projections. This analysis is crucial for understanding the historical production dynamics and making informed decisions for future energy production and distribution


### Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are as follows:

1.  **Trend Analysis**:  To identify and analyze long-term trends in the production of electric and gas utilities.
2.  **Seasonality Detection**: To detect and understand seasonal patterns in the production data.
3.  **Stationarity Check**: To determine if the time series data is stationary or if it requires transformation.
4.  **Model Building**: To develop a suitable time series forecasting model that can accurately predict future production values.
5.  **Insights and Recommendations**: To derive actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis and model outcomes.


### Steps taken

To achieve these objectives, the following steps will be undertaken:

a.  **Data Loading and Preparation:**

    *  Import the dataset and parse the date column to ensure proper time series formatting.
    *  Perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and summary statistics of the data.
    
b.  **Visualization:**

    *  Plot the time series data to visualize the overall trends and seasonal patterns.
    *  Generate decomposition plots to separate the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

c.  **Stationarity Testing:**

    *  Conduct the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity in the time series data.
    *  If the series is non-stationary, apply differencing or other transformations to achieve stationarity.

d.  **Autocorrelation Analysis:**

    *  Plot the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) to identify significant lags and    determine the potential parameters for time series modeling.


e.  **Model Development:**

    *  Use the identified parameters to develop an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model.

f.  **Model Validation:**

    *  Split the data into training and testing sets to validate the model's predictive performance.
    *  Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

g.  **Forecasting:**

    *  Use the validated model to forecast future production values for a specified horizon.
    *  Plot the forecasted values along with confidence intervals to visualize the predictions.

h.  **Insights and Recommendations:**

    *  Interpret the results of the analysis and forecasts.
    *  Provide recommendations based on observed trends, seasonal patterns, and forecasted future production.
